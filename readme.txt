Once all the Java classes have been compiled, a maze can be generated and solved.

---

To generate a maze, input the number of rows, the number of columns 
and the desired file name (one word file names only) in command prompt
after "java MazeGenerator".

i.e.

java MazeGenerator 5 5 filename.txt

---

To solve the maze, input the filename in command prompt after 
"java MazeSolverBFS".

i.e.

java MazeSolverBFS filename.txt
